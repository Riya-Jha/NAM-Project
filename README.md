Project - Prediction of molecular properties using graphs (run the ipynb file)

Molecular properties play a crucial role in drug discovery, materials science, and various other domains. These properties encompass a wide range of characteristics, including but not limited to molecular energy, solubility, toxicity, and biological activity. GNNs can effectively capture the inherent graph structure of molecules, incorporating both local and global information. By leveraging GNNs, we aim to build a robust and accurate predictive model that can predict molecular properties of new compounds to aid drug discovery. We also aim to compare different types of models to determine which one performs best for given task.
